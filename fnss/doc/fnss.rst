Fast Network Simulation Setup (FNSS)
------------------------------------

Fast Network Simulation Setup (FNSS) is a toolchain allowing network researchers and engineers to simplify the process of setting up a network simulation scenario. It allows users to execute the following tasks:

* Parse a topology from a dataset, a topology generator or generate it according to a number of synthetic models
* Apply link capacity, link weights, link delays and buffer sizes
* Deploy application stacks
* Generate event schedules

The FNSS library is made up of two components:

* A core library, which is a Python library capable creating topologies and event schedules and export them to XML files.
* An ns-3 adapter which is an ns-3 module capable of reading the topology and event schedule XML files generated by the core library and run an ns-3 simulation based on them.

In addition to the ns-3 adapter, FNSS also provides adapters for the ns-2 simulator as well as APIs for generic C++, Python and Java simulators. For futher information above the FNSS toolchain, refer to http://fnss.github.io.

Model Description
=================

The source code for the FNSS module is currently at: ``src/fnss``.

As explained above, FNSS is composed of two main components: a core library and and ns-3 adapter. The core library contains all the code required to create and configure a topology and an event schedule. The output of the core library is a set of two XML files: one file describing the topology and all applications deployed on the various nodes and one describing the schedule of events to be executed in the simulation.

Topology
********
An FNSS topology is a list of nodes and links annotated with a number of attributes. Links attributes include capacities, weights, delays and buffer sizes, while node attributes include a list of applications to be deployed on the node. 

When parsing an FNSS topology in ns-3, a network topology is created with all nodes and links. Links are deployed as point-to-point links with capacity, delay, weights and buffers as specified in the FNSS topology XML file.

In addition, in FNSS, it is possible to deploy one or more applications on a network node. An application is simply represented by a named property container, i.e. a set of key-value attributes with a name. In order to deploy applications on network nodes through FNSS, all applications created with the FNSS core library must be named with the name of a ns-3 class exteding ``ns3::Application``, e.g. ``ns3::UdpEchoClient``. In addition, all the properties of the application must be valid attributes of the ns-3 class to which the FNSS application refers.

Event Schedule
**************
An event schedule is a sorted list of events labelled with an execution time. Each event is a set of key-value attributes. To use FNSS event schedules in ns-3 it is necesary to create event schedules whereby each event has an attribute called ``event_type`` whose value the name of an ns-3 class name extending the class ``ns3::FNSSEvent``. This will be the class responsible for executing the event in the simulation. When the event schedule is executed, the class responsible for that event will be instantiated and invoked to execute the event. To pass parameters to the event class, it is necessary to specify event properties in the event schedule named with the name of a valid attribute of the ns-3 event class responsible for handling the event.
